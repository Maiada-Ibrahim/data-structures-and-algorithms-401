# Challenge Summary
find kth from end
argument: a number,k, as a parameter.
Return the nodeâ€™s value that iskplaces from the tail of the linked list

## Whiteboard Process
![](code-challange7.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
kth from end :Big O for time  is O(n)
because use while loop
Big O for space  is O(1)
we didnt create any array in it

## Solution
<{66} -> {6} -> {9} -> {8} -> {3} -> {10} -> {1} -> Null 
deftest_should return index node 9 from last:
 expected = 4  
int index=0
 actual = mylist.;kthfromend(9)  
  assert expected is actual,
 "count from last 

expect: 5


{66} -> {6} -> {9} -> {8} -> {3} -> {10} -> {1} -> Null 
deftest_should return index node 9 from last:
 expected = 4  
 actual = mylist.;kthfromend(9)  
  assert expected is actual,
 "count from last 

expect: 4



{66} -> {6} -> {9} -> {8} -> {3} -> {10} -> {1} -> Null 
deftest_should return index node 9 from last:
 expected = 4  
int index=0
 actual = mylist.;kthfromend(hallo)  
  assert expected is actual,
 "count from last 

expect: 5
