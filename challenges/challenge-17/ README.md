# Challenge Summary
Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree(list,root)
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
## Whiteboard Process
![](challenge-17.png) 

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O for the time is O(n)
becase we loop when we call function

Big O for the space is O(n+c)
c is the node of tree



## Solution
check node and then check the left and right node for this node  after that call function again with the left node 
call function again with the right node
