# Challenge Summary
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.
## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n) it is O(2n)
because using looping but we say O(n)
Space: O(1)
No additional space is being created array while looping




## Solution
To run the server application,

clone down this repo.

'cd' into the cloned repository in your terminal
